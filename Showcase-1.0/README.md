# SHOWCASE-Outdated

This front-end program was designed to act as a portfolio showcase in the early days of my programming experience.

Although the projects are outdated and I've since completed many more exciting and challenging programs, I've included this repository to display my abilities in and understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and web development.
